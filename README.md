Real-Time Messaging with React and WebSocket
Objective: The objective of this assignment is to demonstrate the utilization of WebSocket technology in a React application for real-time message visualization.

Problem Statement: In this assignment, you will develop a React application that connects to a WebSocket server to receive real-time message updates. 

Task 1: Set Up React Project

Initialize a new React project using Vite and a Flask server.
Set up the project structure with necessary folders and files.
Your project should include the ability for a user to "login" with a user name (authentication is not required).
Task 2: Implement WebSocket Connection

Install WebSocket library (e.g., websocket or socket.io-client) using npm.
Create a WebSocket connection to your Flask server in the React application.
Establish event listeners to handle incoming data from the WebSocket server.
Task 3: Emit and Display Messages

Users should be able to send messages that become emitted to all clients
Messages should contain the body of the message along with a username that specifies who sent it. 
BONUS TASKS

Make it so messages displayed by every user on their personal instance of the application are on the right-hand side and instead on the left hand side for all other users connected. (Like a text-message display)
Expected Outcomes: Upon completing this assignment, students should achieve the following outcomes:

Proficiency in setting up WebSocket connections within a React application.
